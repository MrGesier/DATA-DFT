1. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Provides upper, lower, and median bands for four different lengths (256, 128, 64, and 32).
   - Helps identify key price movement zones.

2. **Fourier Transform**:
   - Implements low-frequency Fourier Transform on market data.
   - Decomposes the price into frequency components.

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Overlay Bollinger Bands and Fourier Transform outputs on the price chart.
   - Dynamic transparency and colors for better visual representation.
